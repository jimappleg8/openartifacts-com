OpenArtifacts.com is in its infancy, but we hope that you'll help it grow into a useful tool. 

Open artifacts are anything that humans have created, made available in an open format. You're probably familiar with open source software (OSS). Open artifacts are a superset of OSS meaning that they can include open source software, but also include much more.

If you take a look at the list of open artifacts projects on this site, you'll get a sense of the wide range of things that can be made into open artifacts.
