This is the start of a website dedicated to listing open artifacts projects. The idea is to make them easier to find, so you can contribute to them and grow the whole world-creator ecosystem. It has a sibling at [https://www.openartifacts.org](https://www.openartifacts.org), the home of the Open Artifacts Initiative.

This is a static website built with Jekyll, but I want to build a web app that will be fully searchable and can process special project files like help wanted lists. If you're interested in helping develop this web app let me know.
