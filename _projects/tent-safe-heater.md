This project consists of a twitter account and a Google Docs document. The group has developed a design for a tent-safe heater that burns alcohol. It can be made from easy to find materials for approximately $7, especially if you make a dozen or so at a time.

They have produced a Google Doc document that has been saved as a PDF with instructions on how to use the artifact and how to make them.
