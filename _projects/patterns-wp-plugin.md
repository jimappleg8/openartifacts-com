A pattern language is a specific kind of literary form where patterns (individual pages that explain the solution to a commonly-recurring problem in a given context) are woven together through links and cross-referencing to create something like a body of knowledge. In writing patterns and pattern languages, I've found it difficult to publish them using standard content management systems, so I decided to write a Wordpress Plugin to make the process simpler. This plugin is probably not ready for prime time, but it could be developed further by anyone with a knowledge of Wordpress.
